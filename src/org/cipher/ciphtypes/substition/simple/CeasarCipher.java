/**
 * In cryptography, a <b>Caesar cipher</b>, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher,
 * Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
 * It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a
 * letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3,
 * D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar,
 * who used it in his private correspondence.
 * The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes,
 * such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all
 * single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practiceoffers
 * essentially no communication security.
