     *
     * In arithmetic and computer programming, the extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension
     * to the Euclidean algorithm, which computes, besides the greatest common divisor of
     * integers a and b, the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, that is integers x and y such that
     * a x + b y = gcd ( a , b ) . {\displaystyle ax+by=\gcd(a,b).} ax+by=\gcd(a,b).
     * This is a certifying algorithm, because the gcd is the only number that can simultaneously
     * satisfy this equation and divide the inputs. It allows one to compute also, with almost no
     * extra cost, the quotients of a and b by their greatest common divisor.

     * <b>Least common multiple AKA lcm</b>
     * This algorithm based on modified gcd algorithm.
     * In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple,
     * or smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by LCM(a, b), is
     * the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.[1] Since division of
     * integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both
     * different from zero.[2] However, some authors define lcm(a,0) as 0 for all a, which is
     * the result of taking the lcm to be the least upper bound in the lattice of divisibility.
     * The LCM is familiar from elementary-school arithmetic as the "lowest common denominator"
     * (LCD) that must be determined before fractions can be added, subtracted or compared. The
     * LCM of more than two integers is also well-defined: it is the smallest positive integer that
     * is divisible by each of them.
